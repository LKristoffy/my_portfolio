## üìñ Introduction

This project implements the SimCLR framework for self-supervised learning, leveraging contrastive learning to train an encoder on unlabeled images. By maximizing agreement between augmented views of the same image, the model learns meaningful representations, which are fine-tuned for classification tasks.

## üìÅ Dataset

The project uses a custom dataset, which includes:

1. Unlabeled Images: Used for self-supervised contrastive pretraining.
2. Labeled Images: Used for downstream classification evaluation.

Data augmentations such as cropping, flipping, color distortion, and Gaussian noise were applied to generate augmented views.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Self-Supervised Pretraining:**
  - Trains an encoder to learn robust representations using SimCLR's contrastive learning framework.
- **Data Augmentation:**
  - Applies extensive transformations to create diverse views of the same image.
- **Projection Head:**
  - Utilizes a non-linear MLP for better representation alignment during contrastive learning.
- **Linear Probing:**
  - Evaluates the learned representations on a labeled dataset through a simple linear classifier.
- **Metrics:**
  - Tracks contrastive accuracy, probe accuracy, and loss for both pretraining and evaluation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.8)
- TensorFlow (>= 2.8.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## üíª Implementation Details

1. **Contrastive Pretraining:**
   - Applied extensive augmentations to generate two distinct views of each image.
   - Used cosine similarity to compute similarity between augmented views.
   - Optimized with InfoNCE loss to maximize agreement between views.
2. **Projection Head:**
   - Non-linear MLP to improve representation quality.
3. **Linear Probing:**
   - Evaluated encoder representations with a lightweight classifier.
4. **Metrics and Visualization:**
   - Visualized accuracy and loss curves for both contrastive pretraining and classification.

## üìä Results

The SimCLR model achieved the following results:

- **Contrastive Pretraining:**
  - High contrastive accuracy on augmented image pairs.
- **Downstream Classification:**
  - Improved validation accuracy compared to a baseline model without pretraining.

Sample Results (Validation Accuracy):

| Model           | Validation Accuracy |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Baseline         | 66.4%              |
| SimCLR Pretrained | 53.9%              |

## üöÄ Future Work

1. **Fine-Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune the encoder on labeled datasets for specific tasks.
2. **Extended Augmentations:**
   - Experiment with more advanced augmentations like CutMix or MixUp.
3. **Scalability:**
   - Optimize the model for larger datasets using distributed training.
4. **Application:**
   - Deploy the model for real-world applications such as medical image analysis.
