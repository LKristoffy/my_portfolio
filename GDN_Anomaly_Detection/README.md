# GDN for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection


This is a multivariate time series anomaly detection project applied to a synthetic dataset from Kaggle. 

I have implemented a simple PCA baseline along with an implementation of a paper using a graph neural network along with deviation score from the current time step as a anomaly score.

The results from these notebooks are rather dissapointing, maybe due to the synthetic nature of the dataset not allowing for inter-time-series relationships being found by the graph neural network.

These results do not reflect other results I have achieved using the same GDN in the past.
