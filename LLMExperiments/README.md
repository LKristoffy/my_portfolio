# LLM Experiements

These projects reflect simple playing and unfinished projects using LLMs as a way of better understading them and seeing some of their capabilities.

There is a project of creating an LLM from scratch, using RAG and LangChain to create an educational LLM and a simple finetuning of BERT LLM for sentiment analysis that I am hoping to later stream live inference of tweets using PySpark.
