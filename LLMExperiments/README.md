## ðŸ“– Introduction

This repository houses three experimental projects focused on LLMs. These projects explore different aspects of working with LLMs, including building a model from scratch, integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for educational purposes, and fine-tuning a pretrained model for sentiment analysis.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

### 1. Building an LLM from Scratch

An attempt to understand the fundamentals of LLMs by constructing one from the ground up. The project involves implementing the key building blocks of a transformer-based architecture, including:

- Tokenization and embeddings
- Multi-head self-attention
- Training on a small custom dataset

This project is a work-in-progress and focuses on learning rather than scalability.

### 2. Educational LLM with RAG and LangChain

A project combining Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LangChain to create a simple educational assistant. Key features include:

- **Document Retrieval:** Uses RAG to fetch relevant information from a custom corpus.
- **Conversational Interface:** Implements a LangChain-powered pipeline for generating answers to user queries.
- **Focus on Learning Applications:** Aimed at assisting users with specific topics.

### 3. Fine-Tuning BERT for Sentiment Analysis

This project fine-tunes a pretrained BERT model for sentiment analysis on text data. Highlights:

- **Dataset:** Fine-tuned on a labeled dataset of tweets.
- **Goal:** Perform live inference of sentiment on streaming tweets using PySpark.
- **Current Status:** Fine-tuning completed; streaming pipeline development in progress.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Directions

1. **LLM from Scratch:**
   - Train on larger datasets and improve scalability.
   - Integrate beam search for better output generation.

2. **Educational LLM:**
   - Add support for multimodal input (e.g., images and text).
   - Deploy as a chatbot with real-time querying capabilities.

3. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Complete the PySpark streaming pipeline.
   - Optimize for low-latency inference on real-time tweet streams.
