# Logistic Classifier Implementation

This project shows an implementation of a linear logistic classifier using only numpy. This is then extended with radial basis fucntions (RBFs) for non-linear decision boundaries, momentum implementation during parameter optimisation and an implementation of maximum likelihood grid optimisation of the hyperparameters.

Later a laplacian approximation is used to approximate a full Bayesian approach to find a MAP solution.

The notebook is quite information dense so I will leave this README quite sparse.
